This project implements a balanced 2-way sort merge
Usage: cat 'inputText' | java XSort 'initialRunsLength' 2 > 'nameOfOutputFile'

If the first argument is not provided, the output file will still be created but only the initial
runs will be displayed as noted at the top of the document.

I have only implemented a 2-way sort merge, so 2 should be the only second argument.
Any other number will fail
